This is a simple photo editor with an analog film emulation mode based on the color lookup tables by <a href="http://blog.patdavid.net/2013/09/film-emulation-presets-in-gmic-gimp.html">Pat David</a>.

## Where to start
The interesting code is in [src/image-processing.js](src/image-processing.js). The rest is mostly ui and plumbing.
You can also read my [blog post](http://29a.ch/2015/06/07/javascript-film-emulation/) about it.
